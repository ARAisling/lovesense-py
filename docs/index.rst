lovesense is a library for controlling Lovense sex toys, such as the
Max, Nora, and Lush. The library allows users to control all aspects of
the toy (vibration/rotation/inflation, depending on the toy), as well as
retrieving information like device type, status, battery level, and
accelerometer readings.

The library is currently available in the following languages:

-  `Python <http://github.com/metafetish/lovesense-py>`__
-  `Max/MSP <http://github.com/metafetish/lovesense-max>`__
-  `Rust (with C Headers) <http://github.com/metafetish/lovesense-rs>`__
-  `Javascript/Node.js <http://github.com/metafetish/lovesense-js>`__

If you need an implementation in a language not currently supported by
lovesense, please file an issue on the github tracker of the relevant
project.

Please note that this project has no direct relation to the Lovense
company. These drivers have been developed/supported by the open source
community. Lovense has had no direct participation in this project and
most likely will not be able to answer questions or provide support for
any of the Lovesense drivers.

If you require commercial support for programming for Lovense products,
it is recommended you go through the `Official Lovense Developer
Program <https://www.lovense.com/sextoys/developer>`__.
